    <!-- My Background -->
    <section class="my-background">
      <h2 class="section-title">My Background</h2>
      <p>I have always been fascinated by technology and the internet. My journey into web development started in 2016,
        when I decided to learn more about how websites are built. Since then, I've developed a passion for coding and
        have continuously worked to improve my skills.</p>

      <p>My background in <span class="p-highlight">Information Technology</span> has provided me with a solid
        foundation in problem-solving and critical thinking. This background has been invaluable as I transitioned into
        the world of web development. Whether I am working on a personal project or collaborating with a team, I always
        aim to bring creativity and technical knowledge to the table.</p>

    <!-- Personal Interests -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>Apart from web development, I have a variety of hobbies and interests that keep me inspired. I enjoy
        photography, traveling, reading, and music. These activities help me stay creative and refresh my mind, which
        ultimately contributes to my work as a developer.</p>

      <p>I also believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and I regularly engage in yoga to stay physically
        and mentally fit. This helps me stay focused and productive in my work and life in general.</p>

    <!-- Why Web Development? -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Why Web Development?</h2>
      <p>Web development is more than just writing code for me - it's about solving problems and improving how people
        interact with the digital world. I am particularly interested in creating websites that are not only visually
        appealing but also intuitive and functional.</p>

      <p>I believe that great web design should be accessible to everyone. It's my goal to create responsive and
        user-friendly websites that can be used across a variety of devices, from mobile phones to desktops. My ultimate
        aim is to combine both my creative skills and technical abilities to build websites that provide real value to
        users and businesses alike.</p>

    <!-- Upcoming Personal Projects -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Upcoming Personal Projects</h2>
      <p>As part of my continuous learning and growth, I have several exciting personal projects in the pipeline. These
        projects aim to further improve my skills and contribute to the web development community. Here's a detailed
        glimpse of what I'm currently planning:</p>

      <ol>
        <li class="project">
          <h3 class="section-sub-title1">Multiplayer Game Platform</h3>
          <p><strong>Technologies to be used:</strong> JavaScript, Node.js, WebSockets, HTML5, CSS3</p>
          <p>This project involves creating an interactive, real-time multiplayer game platform where players can engage
            with each other. The game will be a simple action or puzzle game that allows users to challenge others in
            multiplayer matches. The game will feature:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Real-time multiplayer gameplay using WebSockets for fast, low-latency communication between players.
            </li>
            <li>User authentication and registration to track high scores and player profiles.</li>
            <li>A chat system for in-game communication.</li>
            <li>Leaderboards to rank players based on their performance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the backend, I will focus on setting up a Node.js server to handle user sessions, match-making, and game
            state synchronization. This will also involve implementing real-time interactions and ensuring smooth
            gameplay across different devices, focusing on mobile compatibility. The project will give me practical
            experience in real-time communication, backend development, and client-server architecture.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="project">
          <h3 class="section-sub-title1">Cloud Gaming Platform</h3>
          <p><strong>Technologies to be used:</strong> React.js, WebRTC, WebSockets, AWS</p>
          <p>This project aims to build a cloud gaming platform where users can play games directly from their browsers
            without having to install anything on their local devices. The platform will enable users to access a
            library of games from various genres. The key features of the platform include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cloud-based game streaming: Users will be able to play high-end games on low-performance devices by
              streaming the game from a server.</li>
            <li>Real-time multiplayer functionality: Players will be able to interact with each other during gameplay,
              much like a traditional gaming platform.</li>
            <li>WebRTC integration: This will enable low-latency streaming, ensuring smooth gameplay.</li>
            <li>WebSocket-based multiplayer interaction: Players can chat, send messages, or interact in-game in
              real-time.</li>
            <li>Game library management and user accounts: Users can browse a variety of games and save their progress
              on the cloud.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The platform will use AWS services to host the games and provide scalable, high-performance servers to
            handle the load of real-time gameplay. I plan to use React.js to build the frontend interface, and
            WebRTC/WebSockets will ensure that the gaming experience is as fluid and engaging as possible. This project
            will enhance my skills in cloud computing, video streaming, and real-time communication.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>I am excited about these projects and look forward to tackling them over the next few months. Stay tuned for
        updates on my progress as I continue to learn, grow, and build new experiences!</p>
