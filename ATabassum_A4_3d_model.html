      <h2 class="section-title">3D Modeling</h2>
      <p>I have applied 3D modeling extensively throughout my career to build immersive game environments and
        characters-ranging from optimized assets for mobile to high-detail models for cinematic scenes as 3D modeling
        serves as the visual backbone of gameplay experiences.</p>

        <!-- Experience -->
        <h3 class="section-sub-title1">Experience</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Created environment props and character models using Blender and 3DS Max for multiple indie game projects.
          </li>
          <li>Sculpted high-resolution models in Blender and ZBrush, later retopologized for performance optimization in
            games.</li>
          <li>Textured 3D assets using Substance Painter, applying physically based rendering (PBR) workflows for
            realism.</li>
          <li>Rigged and animated humanoid and creature models using Blender's Rigify and Mixamo pipelines.</li>
          <li>Worked closely with Unity and Unreal Engine developers to ensure seamless model integration with proper
            LODs and collision meshes.</li>
          <li>Optimized asset performance by reducing poly count and baking details from high-poly to low-poly models.
          </li>
          <li>Participated in weekly sprint meetings, showcasing 3D progress and collaborating with designers and VFX
            artists.</li>
          <li>Adapted assets for VR and AR platforms with attention to user immersion, scale accuracy, and performance
            metrics.</li>
